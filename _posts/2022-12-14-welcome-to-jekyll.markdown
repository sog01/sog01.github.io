Hi everyone, this is my first article that shares how to get started with Elasticsearch using Go. It covers building a simple HTTP server that can perform basic CRUD operations. After reading this article, I hope you can develop cool projects with Elasticsearch x Go. So, without any further ado, let’s Go for it!

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
